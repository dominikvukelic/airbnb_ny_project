# NY Airbnb Dataset ETL and Visualization

## Overview

This repository focuses on the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process and visualization of the NY Airbnb dataset, obtained from Kaggle. The project provides a structured workflow for cleaning the original dataset, performing exploratory data analysis, and creating insightful visualizations.

## Repository Structure

- **`starting_file/`**: Contains the original dataset from Kaggle.
  - `Airbnb_Open_Data.csv`: The raw data file downloaded from Kaggle.
  - 
- **`cleaning_starting_file/`**: Contains Jupyter Notebook for cleaning and transforming the starting file.
  - `airbnb_ny_df.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook documenting the process of importing the starting file, cleaning, and analyzing it, and exporting the cleaned dataset.
 
  - **`exported_cleaned_starting_file/`**: Contains the cleaned dataset exported from the ETL process.
  - `airbnb_df_cleaned.csv`: The cleaned and processed dataset, ready for analysis.

- **`graphs/`**: Contains Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and visualizations.
  - `graphs.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook documenting the process of cleaning and transforming the starting file, and creating visualizations.

## Usage
